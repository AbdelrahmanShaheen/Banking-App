# Banking-App
**Bankist is a fictitious and minimalistic online banking application that allows the user to**:
- Log in with a username and password.
- View and sort their monetary movements.
- Delete their account
- Do some transactions like :
  - Transfer money between the accounts
  - Requeat a loan from the bank 
## More Features in the App
- View current balance.
- Count down logout timer(when 2mins passed ,the account will be logged out).
## Notes
1. The user data is inside of the script.js file
  so you can fake login with one of these two accounts:
   - user: `js` and PIN: `1111`
   - user: `jd` and PIN: `2222`
2. This site is not currently responsive.
3. The HTML and CSS are already provided by Jonas Schmedtmann and the Javascript work is done by me.
